# Lab 5: Automating UAT with Selenium

## Readings:

* [Selenium tutorial with Python](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/)

In this lab, we will be using the Selenium testing framework to develop automated user acceptance tests. Selenium is an 
open-source web-based automation tool, which can be used to automate various aspects of the User Acceptance Testing 
(UAT) effort. Selenium provides capability to instantiate a browser, simulate user interaction, and test the html 
output.

Your task is to carefully review the tutorial and develop UAT for [Lewis University website](https://www.lewisu.edu).

The UAT must test for the following:
- [ ] Tile of the homepage must include “Lewis University”
- [ ] Home page must include the following links
  - [ ] About Us
  - [ ] Academics
  - [ ] Admission and Aid
  - [ ] Athletics
  - [ ] Student Life
  - [ ] Locations
- [ ] User must be able to navigate to the Faculty/Staff directory from the homepage
- [ ] User must be able to search for “Omari” and get results.

## Deliverables:

- [ ] Python test cases.
- [ ] Screenshots showing that all test cases run successfully.
